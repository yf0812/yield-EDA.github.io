* ⛳ This blog primarily focuses on the issue of **`yield analysis`** in integrated circuits, encompassing both yield estimation and yield optimization. 

* 🎯 We begin with an introduction to the definitions of **`yield estimation`** and **`yield optimization`**, followed by a detailed exploration of the current mainstream research directions in these two areas. 

* 🏆 Ultimately, this site provides a comprehensive summary of the literature on yield estimation and optimization over the past two decades.
